# App

The app serves as the frontend of the restaurant review project for the [Release Engineering for Machine Learning Application](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/remla/) course of the TU Delft.
See [operation](https://github.com/remla23-team13/operation) for a more detailed view of how the project is setup.
On the frontend a user will be able to leave a review for one of the featured restaurants.
Our backend, [model-service](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-service),  will take this review and rate it as either positive or negative.
The reviewer can see this result, and they get the opportunity to indicate whether this was their actual sentiment when writing the review or not.
